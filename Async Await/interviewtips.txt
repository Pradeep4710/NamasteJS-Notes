1. Whats async await?

ans- Async is a keyword which is used with a funciton, await can be used only inside async functions to handle promises. These promises are asynchronous etc.

if possible try and explain promises as well



2. Async/Await vs Promise.then/.catch

ans- Async await is just a syntactical sugarcoat on .then and .catch methods as JS engine uses .then .catch in backend while executing async await only.

prefrably we should use async await only as its easier to implement in sequence we want and is also more in demand at the moment.
